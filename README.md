### Technolgies used

- NFT-PORT : used to create a nft marketplace by deploying smart contracts and minting nfts on a contract address. 
- Polygon - everything is deployed on the polygon network
- moralis for authentication


### Steps to run project

1. npm install
2. create an env file and plug in the correct variables for moralis and nftport
3. npm run dev



### Point of interest

- Pages/api -- contains all the configuration


### Future considerations

- using moralis to store user data and differentiate between a artist and a buyer
- allow users to buy and sell nfts
- convert fiat for crypto on the platform
